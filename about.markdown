My name is a number.

I like 3D. Educated in physics and computer science. 3D modeling hobbyist. Learning web stuff for personal projects and because it'll become a whole lot more relevant in the near future.

Started up this brog because 1. it seems like a good impetus to periodically learn something new and write it up and 2. I've always wanted a decent personal page.

(The header's interactive, by the way. The shader is a gutted version of <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_shaders_sky.html">the sky shader by blurspline</a>, who got it from a few other places.)
