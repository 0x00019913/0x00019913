My name is a number.

I like 3D. Educated in physics and computer science, 3D modeling hobbyist, learning WebGL for personal projects and because it'll become a whole lot more relevant in the near future.

Started up this brog because 1. it seems like a good impetus to periodically learn something new and write it up and 2. I've always wanted a decent personal page.

(Some of the headers are interactive, by the way. For the header with the sun, the shader is a gutted version of <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_shaders_sky.html">the sky shader by blurspline</a>, who got it from a few other places.)

I do occasional 3D printing, for which purpose I'm writing <a href="https://0x00019913.github.io/meshy/">a utility</a> that does measurements and simple transformations on OBJ and STL files. Very much a WIP and will get more functionality in the future.
